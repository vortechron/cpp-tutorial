Collections of simple c++ program for you to get started.

### Tips

+ You forgot to declare the variable.

+ You used the wrong uppercase and lowercase letters; for example, you typed Main when you meant main.

+ You used one equal sign (=) when you were supposed to use two (==), either in an if statement or in a for loop.

+ You forgot #include <iostream> or using namespace std;.

+ You dropped the laptop in the swimming pool.

+ You forgot to call new and just started using the pointer anyway.

+ You forgot the word public: in your classes so everything turned up private.

+ You let the dog eat the remote.

+ You forgot to type the parentheses when calling a function that takes no parameters.

+ You forgot a semicolon, probably at the end of a class declaration.


### THE USUAL C++ HEADER FILES
In C++, a header file holds forward declarations of identifiers. Here are some of the most common C++ header files that you’ll be using, along with their correct spellings. These aren’t by any means all of them, but they are the most common:

+ Include <string> if you’re going to be using the string class.

+ Include <iostream> when you want to use cout and cin.

+ Include <fstream> when you want to read or write files.

+ Include <iomanip> if you want advanced manipulator usage in your streams.

+ Include <stdlib.h> for general operations, including system(“PAUSE”).
