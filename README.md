### Tips

+ You forgot to declare the variable.

+ You used the wrong uppercase and lowercase letters; for example, you typed Main when you meant main.

+ You used one equal sign (=) when you were supposed to use two (==), either in an if statement or in a for loop.

+ You forgot #include <iostream> or using namespace std;.

+ You dropped the laptop in the swimming pool.

+ You forgot to call new and just started using the pointer anyway.

+ You forgot the word public: in your classes so everything turned up private.

+ You let the dog eat the remote.

+ You forgot to type the parentheses when calling a function that takes no parameters.

+ You forgot a semicolon, probably at the end of a class declaration.
